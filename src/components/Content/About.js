      <center><h1>The Vision</h1></center>
      <p>Whether in the midst of a pandemic, a natural disaster, or a law and order situation, a drought or economic crisis, it is a real and meaningful contribution to support those in hardship.</p>
      <p>How can we build a platform that can get response and relief to anyone in their hour of need &ndash; respectfully, with dignity, and in the shortest possible time?</p>
      <p>At the intersection of welfare, policy and technology, this is the question with which this project was conceived.</p>
      <p>This project brought the state government together with a startup, a research institute, an IT multinational.</p>
      <p>We also gained from conversations with a policy think tank, several non-profits, and groups working with migrant workers and the unorganised sector.</p>
      <p>What began as a quick response activity soon grew into this relief management platform: Sankalpa, meaning resolve.</p>
      <p>Financial support, in-kind donations, and on-ground work by covil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, private sector and volunteer groups have all been channelled and coordinated through this platform.</p>
      <p>Sankalpa is a tribute to the tremendous creative energies and deep civic engagement of Bengaluru and Karnataka.</p>
